A History of Reality
====================
Episode 1: A Brief History of the Universe
-------------------------------

### Introduction
> This first episode covers the history of the universe in brief and how it can be considered to be becoming more complex over time.

### Notes
1. Joe, Can you give us the back drop to the story that you are about to tell us; that is the broad sweep of reality and what we mean by something's becoming more complex over time?

1. The Big Bang is the current theory of the origin of the universe. Joe, tell us how this idea was introduced. (What evidence is there for the Big Bang What does it mean for the history of the universe?).

1. The stars are fixed and permanent, they have been in the heavens apparently forever. Joe, tell us when the stars appeared. (What do we know about the chemical composition of the stars. Is this important? So, moving into the area of reality, what influence have the stars had on us?).

1. Moving on to our star, the Sun, and its Solar system. Joe, tell us about the formation of the planets. (Did this involve a change towards complexity? What was reality at this point? Was this a significant event)

1. Is the existence of planets necessary for life itself? Joe, tell us whether the emergence of living things lead to an increase in complexity. (What about interactions? Do interactions themselves cause an increase in complexity).
